    "reason": "A church-like guitar sound is often characterized by a warm, spacious, and reverberant tone. This design boosts the gain in all frequency bands to achieve a warm and full sound, while using longer decay times to create a sense of space and ambiance. The mix level is set to 0.7 to ensure a balanced level between the dry and wet signals."
