    "reason": "To create a distorted sound for piano, the reverb settings apply a gradual decrease in gain for each frequency band, simulating the loss of high frequencies that is characteristic of distortion. The decay times are shorter than those for a natural reverb to emphasize the sharpness and short sustain of distorted sounds. The mix is set at 0.5 to balance the distorted sound with the dry signal."
