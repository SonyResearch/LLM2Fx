    "reason": "An echo effect for guitar is achieved by emphasizing the higher frequencies with higher gain values, while keeping the lower frequencies minimal to create a sense of space and ambiance. The shorter decay times help maintain the echo effect and prevent the sound from becoming too muddy or washed out."
