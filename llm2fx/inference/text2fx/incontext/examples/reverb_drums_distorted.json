    "reason": "The distorted sound for drums is achieved by focusing on mid-to-high frequencies (bands 1-6) to maintain the impact of the drums, while low frequencies (bands 7-11) are reduced to prevent muddiness. The decay times are relatively short to emphasize the transient character of the drums. The mix level is adjusted to blend the reverb with the distorted drum signal."
