    "reason": "Echo drums sound is characterized by a strong focus on high frequencies, along with a short attack and a gradually lengthening decay. This reverb design emphasizes high frequencies by boosting bands 8-11, while keeping the low and mid frequencies flat. The decay times for these high frequency bands are longer than those of the lower bands, creating a sense of an echo. The mix level is set to 0.8 to ensure a balanced level between the dry and wet signals."
