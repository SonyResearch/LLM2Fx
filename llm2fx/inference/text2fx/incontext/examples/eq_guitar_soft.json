    "reason": "To achieve a soft sound for guitar, the EQ focuses on reducing harshness and emphasizing the mid-range frequencies, while attenuating the lower and higher frequencies. Attenuating frequencies below 250 Hz helps remove unwanted warmth and brightness, and a slight low shelf cut at 150 Hz reduces muddiness. Boosting mid-range frequencies at around 800 Hz adds presence and clarity, while keeping the high frequencies relatively flat prevents excessive brightness. A high shelf cut above 8000 Hz helps remove harshness and emphasize the overall warmth and fullness of the sound."
