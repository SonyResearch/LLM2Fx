    "reason": "The reverb is designed to enhance the distorted guitar sound by boosting the low and mid frequencies while gradually reducing the highs. The shorter decay times contribute to a tight and focused reverb tail. The lower mix value ensures the dry signal dominates while still adding a subtle sense of space."
