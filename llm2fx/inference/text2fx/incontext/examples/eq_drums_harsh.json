    "reason": "Achieved a harsh drum sound by applying a low-shelf boost around 60Hz with a narrow Q-factor to emphasize the low-end body and add a punchy and aggressive sound. A notch at around 120Hz reduces excessive resonance, and a low-gain band at 300Hz provides clarity. The band at 600Hz reduces the mid-low frequencies to add punchiness, while the band at 2000Hz reduces the high-mids to reduce sibilance and harshness. The high-shelf boost at 7000Hz adds brightness and clarity to the overall sound."
