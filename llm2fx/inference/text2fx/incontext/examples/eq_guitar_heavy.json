    "reason": "A heavy sound for guitar is achieved by emphasizing the lower frequencies to add weight and punchiness, while reducing high frequencies to minimize harshness. The low shelf boost adds low-end fullness, while the band gains enhance the mid frequencies. The high shelf cut reduces brightness, making the sound more focused and heavy."
