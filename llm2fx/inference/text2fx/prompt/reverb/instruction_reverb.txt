# Instruction Format
Given a reverb description word or phrase and an instrument type, generate appropriate parameters for a frequency-dependent reverb that will achieve the requested spatial character.
For 44100 sample rate audio, Consider the typical reverb needs of the specified instrument when designing the reverb characteristics.

# Input Format
The input will consist of:
1. A reverb description such as:
   - Single words: "hall", "room", "plate", "cathedral", "chamber", "spring", "ambient"
   - Combined descriptions: "warm hall", "bright room", "dark chamber", "short but dense"
   - Spatial descriptions: "distant", "close", "intimate", "huge", "airy", "tight"
2. An instrument type such as:
   - "drums", "guitar", "piano", "vocals", "strings", "brass"

# Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing precise numerical parameters for the reverb. All values should be in float format for efficiency. The output will include:
1. The reverb parameters optimized for the requested spatial character and instrument. All values should be floating point numbers with 2 decimal places of precision.
2. A detailed explanation of how the chosen parameters achieve the desired reverb effect
