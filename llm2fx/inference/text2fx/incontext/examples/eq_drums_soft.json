    "reason": "A soft sound for drums is achieved by reducing the overall low-end presence and emphasizing the mid-range frequencies, which creates a more subdued and muted sound. The low-shelf cut reduces the energy below 100 Hz to minimize the boomy and thunderous character of the drums, while the boosts in the mid-range around 200 Hz and 500 Hz add warmth and clarity. The gentle high-shelf cut ensures the drums do not become too bright."
