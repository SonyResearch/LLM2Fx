    "reason": "To achieve a heavy sound for drums, the EQ focuses on emphasizing the low-end frequency range, enhancing the kick drum and bass drum hits. The low-shelf gain is boosted to increase the overall bass presence. Boosts in the mid-range frequencies further emphasize the kick drum, while a cut around 2000 Hz reduces unwanted harshness. The high-shelf frequency is left flat to preserve the clarity of the high-end cymbals."
